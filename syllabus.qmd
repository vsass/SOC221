### Overview and learning objectives

This course is intended to provide an introduction to basic statistical techniques used by social scientists to better understand the world. We are all bombarded every day with information from all sorts of sources ‚Äì television, online media, marketers, news outlets, and regular interactions with other people in a variety of settings. Figuring out how to organize, consolidate, analyze, and understand these data is at the core of the art and science of statistics. Statistics represent a set of tools that are not only useful for us, as citizens, to understand and interact with the social world, but are also extremely useful in a professional sense; mastery of the art of statistics is a great way to enhance your contributions to employers and the community organizations you serve.

The overall objective is to provide you with the ability to use basic statistical tools to critically evaluate data and to be an effective analytical consumer of information. Successful completion of the course will allow you to:

1. Define real world questions and problems in statistical terms.
2. Analyze data and solve statistical problems.
3. Interpret the meaning of statistical solutions in relation to real world issues.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course. This is not a mathematics course, but you are expected to be capable of doing arithmetic and very basic algebra. You will also be expected to be able to think through problems clearly and communicate your results. This course is designed to help you practice these skills.

### Required materials

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/introductory_statistics_texbook.jpg)
:::

1. *Textbook*: [Introductory Statistics](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/introductory-statistics) from OpenStax College

- The book is available in a wide variety of free online formats via the website linked above. You can use the book in whichever format(s) you like. I recommend that you download the entire PDF so that you always have access to your book.
- If you prefer a physical book, printed copies at a significantly reduced textbook rate are also for sale [here](https://openstax.org/).
- Although the textbook is completely free, if you have the means, I strongly encourage you to [donate to support](https://riceconnect.rice.edu/donation/support-openstax-header?_gl=1*18rb5v7*_ga*MTI4MjYwMzM3Mi4xNzE1MDQwNDcx*_ga_T746F8B0QC*MTcxNTA0MDQ3MC4xLjEuMTcxNTA0MTMxNi43LjAuMA..*_ga_0Q5H4FDCL3*MTcxNTA0MDQ3MS4xLjEuMTcxNTA0MTMxNS44LjAuMA..) their efforts to reduce the cost of textbooks.

2. *Calculator*: You will need a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and take square roots. Bring this device to class every day.

### Ungrading and course structure

There is a disconnect between what grades are designed to do and what truly supports student learning.^[You can read more about the problem with using grades as an assessment for learning [here](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/degrading-de-grading/) and [here](https://www.jessestommel.com/why-i-dont-grade/).] In an effort to focus on your education, assignments and quizzes will not receive a letter-grade or points. Rather, as you answer the questions for each assignment, you will also provide your own assessment of how well-prepared you felt to answer that particular question. At the core of the philosophy behind ungrading is the fact that each of us possesses the best information about our own learning - both *what* works and *if* it's working. As such, I want you to be in control of reflecting on your own learning process throughout this class. 

- **For homework assignments** you will receive written feedback from me about whether you've sufficiently demonstrated mastery of a topic and if not, where you can find assistance in answering that particular question. You'll then have two additional days to revise any questions for re-submission. 
- **For quiz assignments** you'll receive a take-home exam that you'll be given 24 hours to complete. The next day we will use our class time together to go over the questions. If there were any problems you were less sure about, this is a great time to ask questions, and more fully articulate your answers on your assignment before turning in your completed quiz.  

This class is still being taught within the context of a university that assigns grades so I will be required to assign a final grade at the end of the quarter. What that grade ultimately is will be determined by you through your engagement with your assignment self-assessments, revisions on homeworks and quizes, and the two learning assessment meetings we will have (one during week 4 and another our last week of class)^[Specifics on how to prepare for these 15-minute meetings will be provided later in the quarter.]. During these two one-on-one meetings we will have a chance to discuss your learning process, what's worked/what's been challenging, how we can both support the outcomes you desire, and what grade you feel reflects your process. 

For this process to work effectively we are both required to **attend every class** and participate in ways that engage your learning^[If something comes up and you cannot make it to class, message me as soon as possible on {{< var slack.short >}}.]. This means **you are expected to complete and submit all homework and quiz assignments** (***with revisions if applicable***). I will do my best to meet you where you are when you come to class and I ask that you engage in class and with assignments in ways that prioritize your learning.

### Accessibility and accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs\@uw.edu, or through their [website](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, me (your instructor), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.

### Religious accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW\'s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).


### Academic honesty

Students are expected to abide by established regulations on student conduct. Any student found in violation of rules of student conduct will be removed from the class in accordance with state policy and appropriate disciplinary action will be pursued.^[You can read more about the University of Washington Student Code [here](http://www.washington.edu/cssc/student-conduct-overview/student-code-of-conduct/ ).] 


### Basic needs statement	

If you find yourself in need of health services, housing, food, or other basic resources, please use the resources listed below and/or visit the [Resources page](https://soc.washington.edu/resources) on the Sociology Department‚Äôs website.  If you feel comfortable doing so, please contact me about any other unmet needs so that we can brainstorm other resources.
