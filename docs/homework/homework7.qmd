#### Question 2

**The same researcher collected at random one child from each of the eight families in which there was at least one child.  She calculated the following statistics to study the effects of number of siblings (X) on happiness of the child (Y), measured on an interval scale in which low scores indicate a low level of happiness and high scores indicate a high level of happiness.**

#### Question 3

**A personnel specialist with a large accounting firm is interested in determining the effect of seniority (the number of years with the company) on hourly wages for administrative staff. She selects a random sample of 10 secretaries and collects the following data on their years with the company (X) and hourly wages (Y):**

<br> 

| Hourly Wage (Y) | Years with company (X) |   |
|:--------:|:------:|:---:|
| $\bar{y} = \$13.90$ | $\bar{x} = 2.700$ | $r = 0.631$ |

#### Use the following information to answer both questions 5 and 6

**Even in the modern era, countries differ dramatically in terms of the health of their populations. For example, average life expectancy is in the 80’s in some countries but remains in the low 40’s in other countries. Some researchers claim that the most effective way to improve the health of the worst-off populations is to provide more education for people in these countries. To assess this argument, use the following analysis of data from a random sample of countries**

[**Definition of Variables**]{.underline}

* Life expectancy at birth: Average age to which people born right now will live if exposed to current death rates in the country.
* % Literate: Percent of adults in the population that can read and write.
* % Urban: Percent of the country’s population residing in cities.

<br>
<br>

b. Predict the life expectancy for a country in which 75% of the population can read and write.

g. Do these results support the idea that population health (as measured by life expectancy) is affected by education levels (as measured by % literate)? Explain your answer.

<br>

#### Question 6

**A critic of the education argument suggests that any association between literacy and life expectancy is a spurious byproduct of urbanization; in countries in which the population is concentrated in cities people have access to both schooling and health care, creating an association between literacy between literacy and life expectancy that is not causal. To test this argument, interpret Model 2 of the table above.**

a. Write out the regression equation implied in the results for Model 2.
