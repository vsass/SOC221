### Questions

#### Question 1

**A recent magazine article claimed that “our survey results using a random sample indicate that, on average, American adults watch between 75 and 77 minutes of television per day.”**

a. What is the population of interest in this example?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
b. Based on the reported confidence interval, what is the average amount of time spent watching TV for the sample?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
c. What is the margin of error?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
d. What other information is needed to assess the quality of the inference made in this statement?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
e. Name at least two factors that might help to explain the high precision (i.e., small margin of error) for the confidence interval.

#### Question 2

**A social researcher is interested in estimating the number of friends that college students typically made during their first year of school. Questioning a random sample of 50 students at the end of their freshman year, he finds a mean of 3 friends. Assume that the sample comes from a population with a standard deviation of 1.0.**

#### Question 3

**A school principal is interested in assessing the performance of her students on the Totally Oppressive Standardized test (TOST). She selects a simple random sample of 16 of her students and finds the following set of scores:**

<br>

**Assume that the sample is drawn from a population with a standard deviation $\sigma = 7.20$.**

a. What is the average score for the sample of students?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
b. Calculate the standard error.
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
c. Find and interpret the 95% confidence interval for the mean.
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
d. Find and interpret the 99% confidence interval for the mean.
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
e. Why is the margin of error smaller for the 95% confidence interval in question c than for the 99% confidence interval in question d?

#### Question 4

**A mayor of a big city finds that 212 of 400 randomly selected city residents believe that that believes that the city should spend more money on road maintenance. Use this information for a large-sample inference of the proportion of all city residents who believe that the city should be spending more.**

:::

a. What percentage of the sample members believe the city should be spending more?
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
b. Calculate the standard error of the proportion.
<br>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________
<br>
c. Find and interpret the 95% confidence interval for the population proportion.

<br>
d. Based on your findings, is it safe to say that a majority of the city’s population wants more spent on roads? Explain your answer.
