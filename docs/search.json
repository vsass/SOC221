    "text": "This syllabus is subject to change. All changes will be announced both in class, on Slack, and on this page.\n\nCourse info\nInstructor: Victoria (Vic) Sass\nLecture: Mondays & Wednesdays, 9:10-11:20am\nLocation: Savery 132\nOffice Hours: Tuesdays 12-2pm, or by appointment, on Zoom (link on Slack)\nWebsite: https://vsass.github.io/SOC2211\nContact: We‚Äôll use Slack to communicate with each other and you can directly message me there.2\n\n1¬†The course website provides access/updates to the syllabus, scheduling changes, assignments, and other course-related materials. Make sure to check the site often to stay up-to-date.2¬†The invitation to our private Slack has been emailed to everyone registered for the course.\n\nOverview and learning objectives\nThis course is intended to provide an introduction to basic statistical techniques used by social scientists to better understand the world. We are all bombarded every day with information from all sorts of sources ‚Äì television, online media, marketers, news outlets, and regular interactions with other people in a variety of settings. Figuring out how to organize, consolidate, analyze, and understand these data is at the core of the art and science of statistics. Statistics represent a set of tools that are not only useful for us, as citizens, to understand and interact with the social world, but are also extremely useful in a professional sense; mastery of the art of statistics is a great way to enhance your contributions to employers and the community organizations you serve.\nThe overall objective is to provide you with the ability to use basic statistical tools to critically evaluate data and to be an effective analytical consumer of information. Successful completion of the course will allow you to:\n\nDefine real world questions and problems in statistical terms.\nAnalyze data and solve statistical problems.\nInterpret the meaning of statistical solutions in relation to real world issues.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. This is not a mathematics course, but you are expected to be capable of doing arithmetic and very basic algebra. You will also be expected to be able to think through problems clearly and communicate your results. This course is designed to help you practice these skills.\n\n\nRequired materials\n\n\n\n\nTextbook: Introductory Statistics from OpenStax College\n\n\nThe book is available in a wide variety of free online formats via the website linked above. You can use the book in whichever format(s) you like. I recommend that you download the entire PDF so that you always have access to your book.\nIf you prefer a physical book, printed copies at a significantly reduced textbook rate are also for sale here.\nAlthough the textbook is completely free, if you have the means, I strongly encourage you to donate to support their efforts to reduce the cost of textbooks.\n\n\nCalculator: You will need a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and take square roots. Bring this device to class every day.\n\n\n\nUngrading and course structure\nThere is a disconnect between what grades are designed to do and what truly supports student learning.3 In an effort to focus on your education, assignments and quizzes will not receive a letter-grade or points. Rather, as you answer the questions for each assignment, you will also provide your own assessment of how well-prepared you felt to answer that particular question. At the core of the philosophy behind ungrading is the fact that each of us possesses the best information about our own learning - both what works and if it‚Äôs working. As such, I want you to be in control of reflecting on your own learning process throughout this class.\n3¬†You can read more about the problem with using grades as an assessment for learning here and here.\nFor homework assignments you will receive written feedback from me about whether you‚Äôve sufficiently demonstrated mastery of a topic and if not, where you can find assistance in answering that particular question. You‚Äôll then have two additional days to revise any questions for re-submission.\nFor quiz assignments you‚Äôll receive a take-home exam that you‚Äôll be given 24 hours to complete. The next day we will use our class time together to go over the questions. If there were any problems you were less sure about, this is a great time to ask questions, and more fully articulate your answers on your assignment before turning in your completed quiz.\n\nThis class is still being taught within the context of a university that assigns grades so I will be required to assign a final grade at the end of the quarter. What that grade ultimately is will be determined by you through your engagement with your assignment self-assessments, revisions on homeworks and quizes, and the two learning assessment meetings we will have (one during week 4 and another our last week of class)4. During these two one-on-one meetings we will have a chance to discuss your learning process, what‚Äôs worked/what‚Äôs been challenging, how we can both support the outcomes you desire, and what grade you feel reflects your process.\n4¬†Specifics on how to prepare for these 15-minute meetings will be provided later in the quarter.5¬†If something comes up and you cannot make it to class, message me as soon as possible on Slack.For this process to work effectively we are both required to attend every class and participate in ways that engage your learning5. This means you are expected to complete and submit all homework and quiz assignments (with revisions if applicable). I will do my best to meet you where you are when you come to class and I ask that you engage in class and with assignments in ways that prioritize your learning.\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Week\n      Date\n      Topic\n      Required Reading\n      Assignment Due (in class)\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n\nMondayJune 17th\n\n‚ñ™ Introductions to the course‚ñ™ Overview of statistics‚ñ™ Producing data: surveys and sampling\n\nSyllabusChapter 1 (sections 1.1 - 1.2)\n\n\n    1\n\nWednesdayJune 19th\n\nNO CLASS:\n\nJuneteenth Holiday\n\n\n    2\n\nMondayJune 24th\n\n‚ñ™ Frequency tables‚ñ™ Graphical techniques\n\nChapter 1 (sections 1.3 - 1.4)Chapter 2 (sections 2.1 - 2.4)\n\nHomework 1\n\n    2\n\nWednesdayJune 26th\n\n‚ñ™ Measures of central tendency‚ñ™ Measures of variability\n\nChapter 2 (sections 2.5 - 2.6)Chapter 2 (sections 2.7 - 2.8)\n\nHomework 1 returned\n\n    3\n\nMondayJuly 1st\n\n‚ñ™ Probability and probability distributions‚ñ™ Normal distributions\n\nChapter 3 (sections 3.1 to 3.3)Chapter 4 (section 4.1)Chapter 5 (section 5.1)Chapter 6 (sections 6.1 to 6.2)\n\nHomework 2Homework 1 w/ revisions\n\n    3\n\nWednesdayJuly 3rd\n\n‚úçÔ∏èüôãüí°Quiz 1 Review\n\n\nHomework 2 returned\n\n    4\n\nMondayJuly 8th\n\n‚ñ™ Sampling distributions‚ñ™ Central limit theorem‚ñ™ Logic of inference\n\nChapter 7 (sections 7.1 & 7.3)\n\nHomework 3Homework 2 w/ revisions\n\n    4\n\nWednesdayJuly 10th\n\n‚ñ™ Estimation: confidence intervals for means‚ñ™ Estimation: confidence intervals for proportions\n\nChapter 8 (sections 8.1 to 8.2)Chapter 8 (section 8.3)\n\nHomework 3 returned\n\n    4\n\nThursdayJuly 11th\n\nIndividual Learning Assessment Meetings(via Zoom)\n\n\n\n    4\n\nFridayJuly 12th\n\nIndividual Learning Assessment Meetings(via Zoom)\n\n\n\n    5\n\nMondayJuly 15th\n\n‚ñ™ Hypothesis testing for one sample‚ñ™ Hypothesis testing for two samples\n\nChapter 9 (sections 9.1 to 9.6)Chapter 10 (sections 10.1 to 10.3 plus 10.5)\n\nHomework 4Homework 3 w/ revisions\n\n    5\n\nWednesdayJuly 17th\n\n‚úçÔ∏èüôãüí°Quiz 2 Review\n\n\nHomework 4 returned\n\n    6\n\nMondayJuly 22nd\n\n‚ñ™ Two-way tables and chi-square‚ñ™ Scatterplots and correlation\n\nChapter 11 (sections 11.1 to 11.3Chapter 12 (sections 12.1 to 12.3)\n\nHomework 5Homework 4 w/ revisions\n\n    6\n\nWednesdayJuly 24th\n\n‚ñ™ Bivariate regression‚ñ™ Inference for regression\n\nChapter 12 (section 12.4 and 12.5)\n\nHomework 5 returned\n\n    7\n\nMondayJuly 29th\n\n‚ñ™ Multivariate regression\n\nPrimer for multivariate regression\n\nHomework 6Homework 5 w/ revisions\n\n    7\n\nWednesdayJuly 31st\n\n‚ñ™ Multivariate regression\n\n\nHomework 6 returned\n\n    8\n\nMondayAugust 5th\n\nIndividual Learning Assessment Meetings(in-person)\n\n\nHomework 7Homework 6 w/ revisionsHomework 7 returned (via Slack)\n\n    8\n\nWednesdayAugust 7th\n\n‚úçÔ∏èüôãüí°Quiz 3 Review\n\n\n\n    9\n\nMondayAugust 12th\n\nNO CLASS:\n\nVic @ a conference\n\nHomework 7 w/ revisions(in Sociology main office)\n\n    9\n\nWednesdayAugust 14th\n\nNO CLASS:\n\nVic @ a conference\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility and accommodations\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs@uw.edu, or through their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, me (your instructor), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nWashington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form.\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nStudents are expected to abide by established regulations on student conduct. Any student found in violation of rules of student conduct will be removed from the class in accordance with state policy and appropriate disciplinary action will be pursued.6\n6¬†You can read more about the University of Washington Student Code here.\n\nBasic needs statement\nIf you find yourself in need of health services, housing, food, or other basic resources, please use the resources listed below and/or visit the Resources page on the Sociology Department‚Äôs website. If you feel comfortable doing so, please contact me about any other unmet needs so that we can brainstorm other resources. Concerned with your own safety or the safety of others?
