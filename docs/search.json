All changes will be announced both in class, on Slack, and on this page.\n\nCourse Info:\nInstructor: Victoria (Vic) Sass\nLecture: Mondays & Wednesdays, 9:10-11:20am\nLocation: Savery 132\nOffice Hours: Tuesdays 10am-12pm, or by appointment, on Zoom (link on Canvas)\nWebsite: https://vsass.github.io/SOC221\nCanvas: We will only be using the course Canvas site to upload assignments. Don‚Äôt message me on Canvas.\nContact: We‚Äôll use Slack to communicate with each other and you can directly message me there.\nThe course website provides access/updates to the syllabus, scheduling changes, assignments, and other course-related materials. Make sure to check the site often to stay up-to-date.\n\n\nOverview and Learning Objectives:\nThis course is intended to provide an introduction to basic statistical techniques used by social scientists to better understand the world. We are all bombarded every day with information from all sorts of sources ‚Äì television, online media, marketers, news outlets, and regular interactions with other people in a variety of settings. Figuring out how to organize, consolidate, analyze, and understand these data is at the core of the art and science of statistics. Statistics represent a set of tools that are not only useful for us, as citizens, to understand and interact with the social world, but are also extremely useful in a professional sense; mastery of the art of statistics is a great way to enhance your contributions to employers and the community organizations you serve.\nThe overall objective is to provide you with the ability to use basic statistical tools to critically evaluate data and to be an effective analytical consumer of information. Successful completion of the course will allow you to:\n\nDefine real world questions and problems in statistical terms.\nAnalyze data and solve statistical problems.\nInterpret the meaning of statistical solutions in relation to real world issues.\n\n\n\nOverview and Learning Objectives:\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. This is not a mathematics course, but you are expected to be capable of doing arithmetic and very basic algebra. You will also be expected to be able to think through problems clearly and communicate your results. This course is designed to help you practice these skills.\n\n\nRequired materials:\n\n\n\n\nTextbook: Introductory Statistics from OpenStax College\n\n\nThe book is available in a wide variety of free online formats via the website linked above. You can use the book in whichever format(s) you like. I recommend that you download the entire PDF so that you always have access to your book.\nIf you prefer a physical book, printed copies at a significantly reduced textbook rate are also for sale here.\nAlthough the textbook is completely free, if you have the means, I strongly encourage you to donate to support their efforts to reduce the cost of textbooks.\n\n\nCalculator: You will need a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and take square roots. Bring this device to class every day. During quizzes you cannot use a device that communicates with other devices (such as a cell phone) as your calculator.\n\n\n\nAccessibility & Accommodations:\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924, uwdrs@uw.edu, or through their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, me (your instructor), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\n\n\nReligious Accommodations:\nWashington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Date\nTopic\nRequired Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJune 17th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Introductions to the course\n‚ñ™ Overview of statistics\n\n\nSyllabus\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJune 19th\n\n\nNO CLASS: JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJune 24th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Producing data: surveys and sampling\n\n\nChapter 1 (sections 1.1 - 1.2)\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJune 26th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Frequency tables\n‚ñ™ Graphical techniques\n\n\nChapter 1 (sections 1.3 - 1.4)\nChapter 2 (sections 2.1 - 2.4)\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJuly 1st\n\n\n‚ñ™ Measures of central tendency\n‚ñ™ Measures of variability\n\n\nChapter 2 (sections 2.5 - 2.6)\nChapter 2 (sections 2.7 - 2.8)\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJuly 3rd\n\n\n‚ùîReview\nüìä Quiz 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJuly 8th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Probability and probability distributions\n‚ñ™ Normal distributions\n\n\nChapter 3 (sections 3.1 to 3.3)\nChapter 4 (section 4.1)\nChapter 5 (section 5.1)\nChapter 6 (sections 6.1 to 6.2)\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJuly 10th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Sampling distributions\n‚ñ™ Central limit theorem\n‚ñ™ Logic of inference\n\n\nChapter 7 (sections 7.1 & 7.3)\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJuly 15th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Estimation: confidence intervals for means\n‚ñ™ Estimation: confidence intervals for proportions\n\n\nChapter 8 (sections 8.1 to 8.2)\nChapter 8 (section 8.3)\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJuly 17th\n\n\n‚ùîReview\nüìä Quiz 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJuly 22nd\n\n\n‚ñ™ Hypothesis testing for one sample\n‚ñ™ Hypothesis testing for two samples\n\n\nChapter 9 (sections 9.1 to 9.6)\nChapter 10 (sections 10.1 to 10.3 plus 10.5)\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJuly 24th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Two-way tables and chi-square\n‚ñ™ Scatterplots and correlation\n\n\nChapter 11 (sections 11.1 to 11.3)\nChapter 12 (sections 12.1 to 12.3)\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nJuly 29th\n\n\n‚ùîReview\nüìä Quiz 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nJuly 31st\n\n\n‚ñ™ Bivariate regression\n‚ñ™ Inference for regression\n\n\nChapter 12 (section 12.4 and 12.5)\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nAugust 5th\n\n\n‚ñ™ Multivariate regression\n\n\nPrimer for multivariate regression LINK WEBSITE HERE\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nAugust 7th\n\n\n‚ùîReview\nüìä Quiz 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nAugust 12th\n\n\n\n\n\nNO CLASS\n\n\n\n\nThursday\nAugust 14th\n\n\n\n\n\nNO CLASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\nIf you have feedback on any part of this course or the classroom environment I want to hear it!
