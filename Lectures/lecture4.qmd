# Probability and probability distributions {.section-title background-color="#c5b4e3"}

## Inferential statistics

## The challenge of making inferences

## Probability

## Random

## Myths about randomness and probability

## Probability distribution

## Probability rules

Rule 1: The probability P(A) of any event A satisfies 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
Rule 2: If S is the sample space in a probability model, then P(S) = 1
Rule 3: Addition Rule 
Rule 4: Multiplication Rule

## Discrete versus continuous probability distribution

## Probability density function

# Break! {.section-title background-color="#2ad2c9"}

# Normal distributions {.section-title background-color="#c5b4e3"}

## Normal distribution

## Consistent areas under the normal curve

## Standard normal distribution

## Normal distribution and standardized z-scores

## Steps for finding area under the normal curve

*Note: these steps can happen out of order!*

1. Draw the picture, roughly showing the area under the curve that you are looking for (highly recommended)
2. Convert value(s) of interest into z-score(s)
3. Use standard normal table (linked in the back of the book) to find proportion of cases between the mean and the z-score
4. Subtract or add areas under the curve to get the total proportion you are looking for (see the picture from step 1)
5. Convert to percentages or probabilities as required by the problem

## Step 1

## Step 2

## Step 3

## Step 4

## Step 5
