### Questions

*For this assignment, you will help to collect the data to be used for some of the analyses we do in class. You will also assess the nature of the sample we are drawing as we collect these data and think about the nature of some variables in the data.*

#### Question 1

Complete the class survey and ask [**at least three (3)**]{style="color:#e93cac"} other people to do the same. The class survey can be accessed [here](survey.qmd). You are free to invite anyone else – friends, family members, co-workers, etc. – to complete the survey but every respondent (including you!) should complete the survey only once. [You will receive credit for this problem if you complete the survey yourself and at least **three (3) others** enter your **student number** at the end of the survey]{style="color:#e93cac"}. Here is an email invitation that you can send out to get your people to complete the survey:

> Dear [**[ insert name of person here ]**]{style="color:#2ad2c9"},<br>
<br>
The members of my statistics class at the University of Washington have put together an online
survey to collect data that we will use to practice our new statistics skills this term. I am writing
to ask you to please complete the survey. The survey will take about 20 minutes to complete and
your responses will be kept completely confidential; we will not ask for your name or any other
identifying information, so no one in the class will know who you are, and no one outside of our
class will see the survey responses.<br>
<br>
If you are willing to participate, please click on this link:
<https://vsass.github.io/SOC221/homework/survey.html>. <br>
<br>
When you are asked about who referred you to the survey, please enter my student number:<br>
[**[ insert your student number here ]**]{style="color:#2ad2c9"}. <br>
<br>
Please complete the survey only once, even if you receive another invitation from another student.
Thanks very much for your help with this!<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
[**[ insert your name here ]**]{style="color:#2ad2c9"}
