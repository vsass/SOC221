#### Question 2

A researcher collected information on the number of text messages sent over an 8-hour period by a group of teenagers and a group of parents. The data collected are as follows:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
| Case # | Number of Texts | 
|:--------:|:------:|

| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 5 | 
| 6 | 4 | 
| 7 | 11 |
| 8 | 7 | 
| 9 | 9 |

c. Which group – teenagers or parents – had the greatest diversity in the number of texts sent? Support your answer using statistics you calculated for Part a. [Choose the most useful statistics for making your
case].

d. What do your calculations indicate about the shape (symmetrical, negatively/left skewed, or positively/right skewed) of the distributions for the two groups?

#### Question 3

A teacher asked a sample of 18 junior high school students how many hours of television they watched during the previous weekend. The results of the survey are summarized in the following frequency distribution.

::: {.column-margin}

<br>

| Hours of TV | Frequency | 
|:--------:|:------:|
| 5 | 3 | 
| 4 | 5 | 
| 3 | 6 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 1 | 2 | 
| 0 | 0 | 

: {tbl-colwidths="[50, 50]"}
